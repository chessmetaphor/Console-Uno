I made an UNO game you can play in the Console.

This game only goes by classic UNO rules for now.
COMMANDS:
   - ADD: Take one card from the draw pile.
   - Q ADD: Add multiple cards from the draw pile.
   - When it comes time for you to pick your card, they will display to the console with numbers in parentheses next to them.
     EX: || (1) Red 0 || <-- That represents a Red 0 card. To play it you would need to type '1.'
